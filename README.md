# SC1015-miniproject_Group6

## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on music streaming services from 
[ðŸŽ¹ Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset) from Kaggle.

For a walkthrough, follow the source code in order from:
1. [Data Extraction and Cleaning](https://github.com/jwann312/sc1015-miniproject_Group6/blob/main/Data%20Extraction%20and%20Cleaning.ipynb)
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/jwann312/sc1015-miniproject_Group6/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) (As plotly's interactive plot is not supported in Github, do use nbviewer (https://nbviewer.org/) for visualisation of our "average sound features for each genre" plot.)
3. [Song Recommendation System](https://github.com/jwann312/sc1015-miniproject_Group6/blob/main/Song%20Recommendation%20System.ipynb)
